# Project Title: Energy Consumption Analysis

## Description
This project aims to analyze energy consumption patterns in various sectors and regions, focusing on factors such as fuel type, sector, and geographic area. The analysis involves preprocessing data, visualizing trends, and applying machine learning models to understand and predict energy consumption behaviors. The project utilizes Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to set up a Python environment. Make sure you have Python installed, and then install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how to load and preprocess the dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('total_final_energy_consumption.csv')

# Preprocess the data (example)
df['Value'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Value'], errors='coerce').fillna(0)

# Basic data analysis example
print(df.head())
```

For detailed analysis and visualization, refer to the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts provided in the project repository.

## Data

The project uses several datasets, including:
- `total_final_energy_consumption.csv`: Main dataset containing energy consumption data.
- Other related datasets for in-depth analysis.


## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! If you have suggestions or improvements, please fork the repository and create a pull request.
